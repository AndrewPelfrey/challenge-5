# challenge-5

## Description

My motivation behind this application was practice my skills, and also help me learn and advance new skills! I built this app because it is a new and fresh way to put the skills I have learned into use. It also required me to do quite a bit of research on my own, and learn many new things to incoorporate into this app. This app solves the problem of unorganized tasks. This application will keep all of your todo tasks in a neat order, and allow you to move and change the progress of those tasks accordingly. The tasks are also color coded based on how much time you have to do them as a helpful reminder. I learned a lot while building this assignment.  think they main thing I learned is how to properly console log to debug, to solve issues I had throughout my code. I had to do this many times to figure out where my code was breaking. I also got to develop my problem solving skills, and researching skills to find solutions. Overall, this application was very helpful in building my skills and I feel more confident after finishing than when I started.
